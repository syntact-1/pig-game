Pig Game

Pig Game is a fun and interactive dice game that is perfect for honing your JavaScript skills. The game involves two players who take turns rolling a dice. The goal is to be the first player to reach 100 points. Players can roll the dice as many times as they like on their turn, but if they roll a 1, they lose all points for that turn and it's the next player's turn. Players can choose to hold their score, adding their turn total to their overall score and passing the dice to the next player.
